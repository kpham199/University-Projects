Box
Katy Perry
i was living in a small mind with no lifeline and no messages can reach me from the outside when i looked out over the horizon didn't notice the sun was setting or just rising   then it hit me maybe bit me then i knew quite a few would not go with me i didn't know exactly where i would be going but i had to let this river in me flowing   what a ride when you open your eyes for the very first time a real surprise   i started living outside of the box crossing over lines where i always used to stop living outside of the box 'cause i'm not gonna be anybody that i'm not i always knew this day would come when i got off my back found some motivation i've been living on the other side come hell or high water every moment i'm alive   i was living on a fault line the fault was all mine and this unstable ground found me down half the time but i had enough i had to get up i had to shrug it all off 'cause it's the same old stuff  4 then it hit me you won't permit me to be an individual just doesn't fit me but i decided that it's going to be living yeah i decided i'm escaping from your prison  pre what a high when you open your mind for the very first time a real surprise   i started living outside of the box crossing over lines where i always used to stop living outside of the box 'cause i'm not gonna be anybody that i'm not i always knew this day would come when i got off my back found some motivation i've been living on the other side come hell or high water every moment i'm alive  5 so long conformity and ambiguity is a new priority all it takes for heaven sakes is to figure out the face and learn to separate   i started living outside of the box taking my time when i always used to rush living outside of the box cause i'm not gonna be anybody that i'm not i always knew this day would come when i broke down the walls for my liberation i've been living on the other side come hell or high water every moment i'm alive   oh living outside of the box oh living outside of the box oh living outside ha ha ha i always knew this day would come when i got off my back found some motivation   oh living outside of the box of the box of your life of everything that seems nice oh living outside of the box

"They ask you how you are and you just have to say you’re fine"
Katy Perry
you know sometimes you can be blinded by your extreme emotions i definitely was looking for answers during that time when i wrote that song and yeah i was depressed and sad and there were thoughts but there were never actions thankfully but i wanted to share that side of my story because i know there are so many other people out there that have gone through things like that and you always feel like youre the only one going through that you walk out the door and you see someone you know and they ask you how you are and you just have to say youre fine when youre not really fine but you just cant get into it because they would never understand well then comes along a song that speaks to you that makes you feel like gosh i can get through this if she can get through this i can get through this'

Winter
Khalid
i lost my heart in the nighttime she left me out in the cold she left me broken and weary drunk off the lies she told i fell in love in the morning but when the day gets cold i'm back to life in my lonely city of el paso   but the days get harder in november love grows colder in the winter all the things you say i'll remember promise that you'll keep my love with ya promise that you'll keep my love with ya promise that you'll keep my love with ya love grows colder in the winter promise that you'll keep my love with ya   i lost my mind when you left me and i didn't have much of that but you were so quick to reject me so i'll take my time being sad i fell so hard i'll admit it the feeling wasn't mutual so i'm back to live on my lonely in the city of el paso   but the days get harder in november love grows colder in the winter all the things you say i'll remember promise that you'll keep my love with ya promise that you'll keep my love with ya promise that you'll keep my love with ya love grows colder in the winter promise that you'll keep my love with ya   promise promise promise promise promise promise promise promise promise promise that you'll keep my love keep my love promise promise promise promise promise promise promise promise promise promise that you'll keep my love keep my love   but the days get harder in november love grows colder in the winter all the things you say i'll remember promise that you'll keep my love with ya promise that you'll keep my love with ya promise that you'll keep my love with ya love grows colder in the winter promise that you'll keep my love with ya

Motion
Khalid
you'd rather speak more than listen and that's based off our first impression i'm new to all this affection but i'm going in the right direction floating through different dimensions but not losing sense of religion honey i forgot to mention i'm so entranced by you it hurts   i'm in love with the moment see me floatin' see me glowin' i'm in love with the moment see me floatin' see me glowin'   can't let me go if i'm fallin' i've been on the path of importance let the love pull you in slowly the river is running we're flowing i'm coming down you've been rollin' and we're letting free now we're open pour me a pour me a potion i'm rocking i'm rocking the motion   i'm in love with the moment see me floatin' see me glowin' i'm in love with the moment see me floatin' see me glowin'   nothing feels better than this now left right left right take it back bring it side to side like that like that ayy ooh now left right left right take it back bring it side to side like nothing feels better than this now left right left right take it back bring it side to side like that like that ayy ooh now left right left right take it back bring it side to side like nothing feels better than this  that made me feel like i'm just speeding doing 60 in a 5 we're sitting in a car and just holding hands
Perfect
Khalid
ready i can't get this thing to stop squeaking laughs alright ready riley ready    4   i've been on my own for a long time i'm feelin' kinda lonely nothing's fun when i'm the only one out here who knows me something's stopping me from becoming a better person i could try to pace myself but i don't think that it's worth it   what's the point in workin' if a wish is never certain i know i'll never be perfect   i went for a walk last night i swear it was for hours happiness is far from reachin' inside of my power my friends say that i'm changin' changin' like the weather mom says i look sick pop says keep my head up   what's the point in workin' if a wish is never certain i know i'll never be perfect   man i'm thinking out loud where i know someone will hear me cryin' out for help in search of someone near me and i see a growin' boy whenever i look in the mirror told me pain is temporary and my vision's comin' clearer   i'm not used to workin' a wish is never certain i know i'll never be perfect   no no i'm not used to workin' a wish is never certain but at least i'll never be perfect

Nothing Lasts Forever
Maroon 5
it is so easy to see dysfunction between you and me we must free up these tired souls before the sadness kills us both i tried and tried to let you know i love you but i'm letting go it may not last but i don't know just don't know  pre if you don't know then you can't care and i show up but you're not there but i'm waiting and you want to still afraid that i will desert you   everyday with every worthless word we get more far away the distance between us makes it so hard to stay but nothing last forever but be honest babe it hurts but it may be the only way   a bed that's warm with memories can heal us temporarily but misbehaving only makes the ditch between us so damn deep built a wall around my heart never let it fall apart strangely i wish secretly it would fall down while i'm asleep  pre if you don't know then you can't care and i show up but you're not there but i'm waiting and you want to still afraid that i will desert you baby   everyday with every worthless word we get more far away the distance between us makes it so hard to stay but nothing last forever but be honest babe it hurts but it may be the only way   but we have not hit the ground doesn't mean we're not still falling oh i want so bad to pick you up but you're still too reluctant to accept my help what a shame i hope you find somewhere to place the blame but until then the fact remains   everyday with every worthless word we get more far away the distance between us makes it so hard to stay nothing last forever but be honest babe it hurts but it may be the only way   everyday with every worthless word we get more far away the distance between us makes it so hard to stay but nothing last forever but be honest babe it hurts but it may be the only way

Barnyard Song
Taylor Swift
you turn your dial to 97 broadway acts like he's  self-proclaimed say's he's the worst mistake ever to land in michigan i'm just a singer of country songs just trying to play  and not do no wrong but if you listen to just one thing i say   you should turn z9 on broadway's electric barnyard i sing a song called tim mcgraw request it and they'll play it all day long i sing in stations all day long but there's nothing like when you're on the electric barnyard   daisy's from a trailer park in st louis growing up not wearing any shoes prettiest hillbilly girl you'll see all day growing up the other trailer park girls couldn't hide their jealousy because she had the only phone for miles now she uses it as a dj   so you should turn z9 on broadway's electric barnyard i sing a song called tim mcgraw request it and they'll play it all day long i sing in stations all day long but there's nothing like when you're on

Evermore [Forward]
Taylor Swift
to put it plainly we just couldnt stop writing songs to try and put it more poetically it feels like we were standing on the edge of the folklorian woods and had a choice to turn and go back or to travel further into the forest of this music we chose to wander deeper in ive never done this before in the past ive always treated albums as oneoff eras and moved onto planning the next one after an album was released there was something different with folklore in making it i felt less like i was departing and more like i was returning i loved the escapism i found in these imaginarynot imaginary tales i loved the ways you welcomed the dreamscapes and tragedies and epic tales of love lost and found into your lives so i just kept writing them

Ours
Taylor Swift
elevator buttons and morning air strangers' silence makes me want to take the stairs if you were here we'd laugh about their vacant stares but right now my time is theirs seems like there's always someone who disapproves they'll judge it like they know about me and you and the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do the jury's out but my choice is you   so don't you worry your pretty little mind people throw rocks at things that shine and life makes love look hard the stakes are high the water's rough but this love is ours   you never know what people have up their sleeves ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles but i don't care 'cause right now you're mine   and you'll say don't you worry your pretty little mind people throw rocks at things that shine and life makes love look hard the stakes are high the water's rough but this love is ours   and it's not theirs to speculate if it's wrong and your hands are tough but they are where mine belong and i'll fight their doubt and give you faith with this song for you  breakdown 'cause i love the gap between your teeth and i love the riddles that you speak and any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos will be ignored 'cause my heart is yours   so don't you worry your pretty little mind people throw rocks at things that shine and life makes love look hard don't you worry your pretty little mind people throw rocks at things that shine but they can't take what's ours they can't take what's ours   the stakes are high the water's rough but this love is ours

Reputation [Prologue]
Taylor Swift
here's something i've learned about people  we think we know someone but the truth is that we only know the version of them they have chosen to show us we know our friend in a certain light but we don't know them the way their lover does just the way their lover will never know them the same way that you do as their friend their mother knows them differently than their roommate who knows them differently than their colleague their secret admirer looks at them and sees an elaborate sunset of brilliant color and dimension and spirit and pricelessness and yet a stranger will pass that person and see a faceless member of the crowd nothing more we may hear rumors about a person and believe those things to be true we may one day meet that person and feel foolish for believing baseless gossip  this is the first generation that will be able to look back on their entire life story documented in pictures on the internet and together we will all discover the aftereffects of that ultimately we post photos online to curate what strangers think of us but then we wake up look in the mirror at our faces and see the cracks and scars and blemishes and cringe we hope someday we'll meet someone who will see that same morning face and instead see their future their partner their forever someone who will still choose us even when they see all of the sides of the story all the angles of the kaleidoscope that is you  the point being despite our need to simplify and generalize absolutely everyone and everything in this life humans are intrinsically impossible to simplify we are never just good or just bad we are mosaics of our worst selves and our best selves our deepest secrets and our favorite stories to tell at a dinner party existing somewhere between our welllit profile photo and our drivers license shot we are all a mixture of our selfishness and generosity loyalty and selfpreservation pragmatism and impulsiveness i've been in the public eye since i was 5 years old on the beautiful lovely side of that i've been so lucky to make music for living and look out into crowds of loving vibrant people on the other side of the coin my mistakes have been used against me my heartbreaks have been used as entertainment and my songwriting has been trivialized as 'oversharing'  when this album comes out gossip blogs will scour the lyrics for the men they can attribute to each song as if the inspiration for music is as simple and basic as a paternity test there will be slideshows of photos backing up each incorrect theory because it's 07 and if you didn't see a picture of it it couldn't have happened right  let me say it again louder for those in the back  we think we know someone but the truth is that we only know the version of them that they have chosen to show us  there will be no further explanation there will be just reputation

The Moment I Knew

you should've been there should've burst through the door with that baby i'm right here smile and it would've felt like a million little shining stars had just aligned and i would've been so happy   christmas lights glisten i've got my eye on the door just waiting for you to walk in but the time is ticking people ask me how i've been as i comb back through my memory how you said you'd be here you said you'd be here   and it was like slow motion standing there in my party dress in red lipstick with no one to impress and they're all laughing as i'm looking around the room but there was one thing missing and that was the moment i knew   and the hours pass by now i just wanna be alone but your close friends always seem to know when there's something really wrong so they follow me down the hall and there in the bathroom i try not to fall apart and the sinking feeling starts as i say hopelessly he said he'd be here   and it was like slow motion standing there in my party dress in red lipstick with no one to impress and they're all laughing and asking me about you but there was one thing missing missing and that was the moment i knew   what do you say when tears are streaming down your face in front of everyone you know and what do you do when the one who means the most to you is the one who didn't show  breakdown you should've been here and i would've been so happy   and it was like slow motion standing there in my party dress in red lipstick with no one to impress and they're all standing around me singing happy birthday to you but there was one thing missing and that was the moment i knew ohohohohohohoh i knew ohohohohohohoh   you called me later and said i'm sorry i didn't make it and i said i'm sorry too and that was the moment i knew
The Other Side of the Door
Taylor Swift
in the heat of the fight i walked away ignoring words that you were saying trying to make me stay i said this time i've had enough and you've called a hundred times but i'm not picking up 'cause i'm so mad i might tell you that it's over but if you look a little closer   i said leave but all i really want is you to stand outside my window throwing pebbles screaming i'm in love with you wait there in the pouring rain come back for more and don't you leave 'cause i know all i need is on the other side of the door   me and my stupid pride are sitting here alone going through the photographs staring at the phone i keep going back over things we both said and i remember the slamming door and all the things that i misread so babe if you know everything tell me why you couldn't see when i left i wanted you to chase after me   yeah i said leave but all i really want is you to stand outside my window throwing pebbles screaming i'm in love with you wait there in the pouring rain come back for more and don't you leave 'cause i know all i need is on the other side of the door   and i'll scream out the window i can't even look at you i don't need you but i do i do i do i say there's nothing you can say to make this right again i mean it i mean it what i mean is   i said leave but baby all i want is you to stand outside my window throwing pebbles screaming i'm in love with you wait there in the pouring rain come back for more and don't you leave 'cause i know all i need is on the other side of the door   with your face and the beautiful eyes and the conversation with the little white lies and the faded picture of a beautiful night you carried me from your car up the stairs and i broke down crying was she worth this mess after everything and that little black dress after everything i must confess i need you
