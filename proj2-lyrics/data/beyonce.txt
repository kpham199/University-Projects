Gender Equality is a Myth!
Beyonce
we need to stop buying into the myth about gender equality it isnt a reality yet today women make up half of the us workforce but the average working woman earns only 77 percent of what the average working man makes but unless women and men both say this is unacceptable things will not change men have to demand that their wives daughters mothers and sisters earn more commensurate with their qualifications and not their gender equality will be achieved when men and women are granted equal pay and equal respect  humanity requires both men and women and we are equally important and need one another so why are we viewed as less than equal these old attitudes are drilled into us from the very beginning we have to teach our boys the rules of equality and respect so that as they grow up gender equality becomes a natural way of life and we have to teach our girls that they can reach as high as humanly possible  we have a lot of work to do but we can get there if we work together women are more than 50 percent of the population and more than 50 percent of voters we must demand that we all receive 00 percent of the opportunities

Honesty
Beyonce
if you search for tenderness it isn't hard to find you can have the love you need to live but if you look for truthfulness you might just as well be blind it always seems to be so hard to give   honesty is such a lonely word everyone is so untrue honesty is hardly ever heard and mostly what i need from you   i can always find someone to say they sympathize if i wear my heart out on my sleeve but i don't want some pretty face to tell me pretty lies all i want is someone to believe   honesty is such a lonely word everyone is so untrue honesty is hardly ever heard and mostly what i need from you   i can find a lover i can find a friend i can have security until the bitter end anyone can comfort me with promises again i know i know   when i'm deep inside of me don't be too concerned i won't ask for nothin' while i'm gone but when i want sincerity tell me where else can i turn because you're the one that i depend upon   honesty is such a lonely word everyone is so untrue honesty is hardly ever heard and mostly what i need from you

If I Were a Boy
Beyonce
if i were a boy even just for a day i'd roll out of bed in the morning and throw on what i wanted then go drink beer with the guys and chase after girls i'd kick it with who i wanted and i'd never get confronted for it 'cause they'd stick up for me   if i were a boy i think i could understand how it feels to love a girl i swear i'd be a better man i'd listen to her 'cause i know how it hurts when you lose the one you wanted 'cause he's taken you for granted and everything you had got destroyed   if i were a boy i would turn off my phone tell everyone it's broken so they'd think that i was sleepin' alone i'd put myself first and make the rules as i go 'cause i'd know that she'd be faithful waitin' for me to come home to come home   if i were a boy i think i could understand how it feels to love a girl i swear i'd be a better man i'd listen to her 'cause i know how it hurts when you lose the one you wanted wanted 'cause he's taken you for granted granted and everything you had got destroyed   it's a little too late for you to come back say it's just a mistake think i'd forgive you like that if you thought i would wait for you you thought wrong   but you're just a boy you don't understand yeah you don't understand oh how it feels to love a girl someday you'll wish you were a better man you don't listen to her you don't care how it hurts until you lose the one you wanted 'cause you've taken her for granted and everything you have got destroyed but you're just a boy

Say My Name
Destiny's Child
Say my name, say my name If no one is around you, say, "Baby, I love you" If you ain't runnin' game Say my name, say my name You actin' kinda shady, ain't callin' me "baby" Why the sudden change? Say my name, say my name If no one is around you, say, "Baby, I love you" If you ain't runnin' game Say my name, say my name You actin' kinda shady, ain't callin' me "baby" Better say my name Any other day I would call, you would say "Baby, how's your day?" But today, it ain't the same Every other word is "Uh-huh, yeah, okay" Could it be that you are at the crib with another lady? If you took it there, first of all, let me say I am not the one to sit around and be played So prove yourself to me if I'm the girl that you claim Why don't you say the things that you said to me yesterday? I know you say that I am assuming things Something's goin' down, that's the way it seems Shouldn't be no reason why you're actin' strange If nobody's holdin' you back from me 'Cause I know how you usually do Where you're sayin' everything to me times two Why can't you just tell the truth? If somebody's there then tell me who What is up with this? Tell the truth, who you with? How would you like it if I came over with my clique? Don't try to change it now sayin' you gotta bounce When two seconds ago said you just got in the house It's hard to believe that you are at home by yourself When I just heard the voice, heard the voice of someone else Just this question, why do you feel you gotta lie? Gettin' caught up in your game when you cannot say my name

Si Yo Fuera un Chico
Beyonce
letra de si yo fuera un chico  verso  si yo fuera un chico sólo por una vez yo me vestiría como quiero con lo que vea primero y me voy saldría a buscar chicas por montón mis amigos que son leales siempre van a acompañarme hasta el fin cada noche a mentir  coro si yo fuera un chico sé que podría saber comprender mucho mejor lo que es amar a una mujer sabría escuchar pues conozco el dolor de perder a quien se quiere porque ignoras lo que tienes y quedas sin saber que pasó  verso  si yo fuera un chico pero ves no lo soy los chicos son de un molde y nosotras somos de corazón se piensan que son los del sexo superior pero cuando lo queremos nos vence nuestra seducción  coro si yo fuera un chico sé que podría saber comprender mucho mejor lo que es amar a una mujer sabría escuchar pues conozco el dolor de perder a quien se quiere porque ignoras lo que tienes y quedas sin saber que pasó  puente es muy tarde ya ves para regresar perdonarte otra vez ya no lo vas a lograr el lugar que ocupabas tú ya no está más  coro pero eres un chico que le vas a hacer no puedes comprender que se siente al comprender mejor y amar en serio a una mujer no sabes escuchar no te importa el dolor hasta que pierdes a quien quieres porque ignoras lo que tienes y quedas sin saber que pasó pero eres un chico
