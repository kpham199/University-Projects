## Lyrics-DB – Song Search Engine

**Course:** CS 251 - Data Structures  
**Term:** Fall 2025  
**Concepts:** C++, Data Structures (Maps, Sets)

A powerful command-line search engine for song lyrics. Built using an inverted index, it supports advanced Boolean queries (AND, OR, NOT) across thousands of songs.

### Core Components
- Inverted index for O(1) word-to-song lookups  
- Boolean query parser supporting `+`, `-`, and default operators  
- Text tokenization and normalization pipeline  
- Artist and song title indexing  
- Interactive command-line interface  

### Skills Demonstrated
- Efficient data structure usage (maps, sets)  
- Set operations and algorithmic logic  
- Test-driven development with GoogleTest  
- C++ STL mastery and code modularity
